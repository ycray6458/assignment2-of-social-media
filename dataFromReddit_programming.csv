"There’s a reason that programmers always want to throw away old code and start over: they think the old code is a mess. They are probably wrong. The reason that they think the old code is a mess is because of a cardinal, fundamental law of programming: It’s harder to read code than to write it.",8f2lzu,2018-04-26 21:24:12,,"I think most programmers work in a similar way: imagine a problem, then decompose the problem into its constituent parts and attack those simpler, isolated problems.

The problem with a large codebase is that no one, not even the person that wrote all of it can fit the solution in their working memory. The tendency of programmers (who generally underestimate complexity) is to say: wait a minute, this problem doesn't require 10 million LOC, I could easily solve this problem in 250 lines of elegant Haskell.

There are situations where the legacy codebase is completely unsalvagable, but I think more often than not it's throwing the baby out with the bath water, except the baby is an engine that, while flawed, is generating business value."

"TIL there's a community called ""dwitter"" where people compose 140 character JavaScript programs that produce interesting visuals",7m8770,2017-12-26 23:05:01,,"Now that the server seems to be under control, let me high-jack my top comment to give you some tips:

  - You can edit the code live! Try changing a few numbers
  - Click the ""New Dweet"" button to get a less crazy starting point. It even has some comments!
  - If you edit someone elses dweet, you can post it directly from their post; this tags it as a ""remix"" and is preferred over just copy-pasting into ""New Dweet"" as it preserves the link to the original.
  - dwitter.net/random is a good way to see dweets of variable complexity
  - and dwitter.net/new is where all the fresh redditor dweets have started to pop up :D 

And it's a ton of fun to see all the excitement :) Might have to get back to working on it.  (github.com/lionleaf/dwitter if you want to contribute)

Inventor says Google is patenting work he put in the public domain,8q3kp8,2018-06-11 04:23:17,,"The stupid thing about how software patents work is that if you don't apply for it, anybody else could try to do so later and if they succeed (which is always a chance since patent officers often have no idea what the fuck they're doing), they can fuck you over with it. I could imagine that Google just decided to try as hard as possible to patent whatever the fuck they can about this important new technology... if they fail, they at least made (relatively) certain that nobody else can later do it either.

The best option for the inventor would've probably been to patent it himself and grant the world an irrevokable royalty-free license, rather than not patenting it at all. Patents are not free, unfortunately, but it seems that he cares enough about this that he might have been willing to put out the money. With the way this stupid system works, the only way you can make sure that nobody else takes it is to claim it for yourself."

> Adobe is planning to end-of-life Flash. Specifically, we will stop updating and distributing the Flash Player at the end of 2020 and encourage content creators to migrate any existing Flash content to these new open formats.

Google:

> Chrome will continue phasing out Flash over the next few years, first by asking for your permission to run Flash in more situations, and eventually disabling it by default. We will remove Flash completely from Chrome toward the end of 2020.

Mozilla: 

> Starting next month, users will choose which websites are able to run the Flash plugin. Flash will be disabled by default for most users in 2019, and only users running the Firefox Extended Support Release (ESR) will be able to continue using Flash through the final end-of-life at the end of 2020. In order to preserve user security, once Flash is no longer supported by Adobe security patches, no version of Firefox will load the plugin.

Microsoft:

> - In mid to late 2018, we will update Microsoft Edge to require permission for Flash to be run each session. Internet Explorer will continue to allow Flash for all sites in 2018.
> - In mid to late 2019, we will disable Flash by default in both Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer. Users will be able to re-enable Flash in both browsers. When re-enabled, Microsoft Edge will continue to require approval for Flash on a site-by-site basis.
> - By the end of 2020, we will remove the ability to run Adobe Flash in Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer across all supported versions of Microsoft Windows. Users will no longer have any ability to enable or run Flash.

In my opinion we need to compare coding interviews to the alternatives. Should it just be a generic career interview? Then it favors people who are more personable provides greater opportunity for bias. Should people get take homes? That is even more of a time commitment on the part of the candidate. Should we de-emphasize the interview and rely more on experience? Then people who get bad jobs early in their career are in trouble for life. Should we go by referrals/letters of recommendation? Then it encourages nepotism.

I am not saying we should never use any of these things, or that we should always use skills based interviews. I think we need to strike a balance between a lot of very imperfect options. But  honestly hiring just sucks and there is no silver bullet."

"In major copyright battle between tech giants, SCOTUS sides w/ Google over Oracle, finding that Google didnt commit copyright infringement when it reused lines of code in its Android operating system.",mklggn,2021-04-05 22:04:41,,"> The  copied lines of code are part of a “user interface” that provides a way for programmers to access prewritten computer code through the use of simple  commands.    As  a  result,  this  code  is  different  from  many  other  types of code, such as the code that actually instructs the computer to execute a task.  As part of an interface, the copied lines are inherently bound together with uncopyrightable ideas (the overall organization of the  API)  and  the  creation  of  new  creative  expression  (the  code  independently written by Google).  Unlike many other computer programs, the value of the copied lines is in significant part derived from the investment of users (here computer programmers) who have learned the API’s system.  Given these differences, application of fair use here is unlikely to undermine the general copyright protection that Congress provided for computer programs.

The opinion demonstrates a clear understanding of software and programming. I am shocked, but delighted. I was pessimistic about the outcome of this case, because I thought that the judges would not be able to handle the technical material, but I seriously underestimated the Court.

Eight freelancers responded with offers ranging from €100 to €177. The time ranged from 3 to 10 days. We arbitrarily chose one with an average expectation of compensation (€148) and 3 working days delivery time.

Fifteen developers made an application for the project. Their compensation proposals ranged from €55 to €166 and the expected working time ranged from 1 to 15 days.

Reddit will begin charging for access to its API,12r0xyz,2023-04-19 03:19:25,,"Apollo iOS reddit app developer talked with the admins and this seems to be much worse than originally though. 

1. This WILL affect third party Reddit clients like Apollo. It will most likely affect Sync as well. Maybe the smaller clients will still fall under the free tier.
2. The current vague plan is to block NSFW content. So any third party reddit app that exists after will not be able to access that content. That's not just porn, that's anything considered violent/gory, and anything considered a legal grey area. A vaping sub I follow has to mark all posts as NSFW to ensure some baseline of age gating. 
3. The admins do not have a lot of concrete answers. A lot of ""reasonably priced"" and ""reasonable amount of data"" wording.

"Announcing 1.1.1.1: the fastest, privacy-first consumer DNS service",88sfa1,2018-04-02 01:24:56,,"The history of the IP address 1.1.1.1 is quite interesting. It is (or was) owned by APNIC, who never allocated it because it's probably the IP address that's most commonly used in an unauthorised way (i.e. by people who are just using it for testing, using it for something internal under the assumption that  it's not publicly routed, or the like); this wasn't helped by the fact that the 1.0.0.0/8 block was not allocated for quite a while. Every now and then they experimentally put a server there to see what happened, and it pretty much instantly got DDOSed by the apparently large number of computers out there which are trying to route things via it despite it not having been an allocated IP. (There are a few other IP addresses with similar circumstances, such as 1.2.3.4, but 1.1.1.1 had this effect the worst.)

It makes sense that it'd end up going to a company like Cloudflare, who presumably has the capacity to handle an IP address whose pattern means that it's more or less inherently DDOSed simply by existing. (Its whois information currently lists it as being owned jointly by APNIC and Cloudflare.) It's fairly impressive that Cloudflare managed to get a server up and running on it (https://1.1.1.1/ is accepting connections and is hosting a site, so you can check for yourself that there's a server there right now). That'd be a lot of effort to go to for an April Fools joke, and it's proof that they can overcome the difficulties with using this IP in particular, so it's quite likely that this is real. So presumably that means that a whole lot of misconfigured systems are broken right now (and likely to continue broken into the future)."

Programming becomes part of Finnish primary school curriculum - from the age of 7,2ffw1d,2014-09-04 17:46:49,,"A lot of people seem to be assuming they are immediately going to teach first-graders some actual programming language.

That is not the case.

Shortened from [Source](http://koodi2016.fi/ops.html#section-1) (Finnish):

* Grades 1-2: Giving unambiguous command sequences to another person.
* Grades 3-6: Using some kind of visual programming environment (not an actual programming language).
* Grades 7-9: Actual programming language.

**EDIT:** Well, I guess I could write a fuller translation of the ""Mitä eri luokilla opiskellaan?"" section:
> Changes in the different grades go like this:
> 
> **On grades 1-2** pupils will be taught to give unambigious commands to other persons. Programming is giving commands to a computer, and this will prepare for that.
>
> ""Learning to give exact instructions, such as 'take three steps forward' - not 'take three steps', that could also be backward or sideways steps"", Pahkin says.
>
> ""It will be learnt that exact instructions produce exact actions, and inexact instrictions produce inexact actions.""
>
> **On grades 3-6** they start to do something that is closer to programming. The tool is not yet an actual programming language but some visual programming environment, where you essentially work with a mouse, not by writing.
>
> ""At this point we switch a person to a computer. Then you will need some kind of a language - in practice, on these grades, that will be some 'graphical programming language'"", Pahkin explains.

> ""Programming can be practiced by dragging and moving things. Finding those different commands, that e.g. Scratch \[MIT-developed children's programming environment\] only has a few of. After this, finding e.g. repeating with those few commands. All of these can be quickly learned.""

> **On grades 7-9** they start to study an actual programming language. ""We do not take a stance on which language it will be"", Pahkin says. ""But the idea is that they understand the basics of a language and they can understand program code - here the program takes an integer in, here it does something for it, etc.""

Thanks to them, we have accurate emulation of not just the SNES, but of almost every cartridge module known to the world, as well as the insane suite that is ares. 

Near was a massive source of inspiration, both for devs and for users.

Near has always been a positive influence in the community, save some minor heated discussions and incidents. This is a horrible loss, and even though I'd like to believe the theories/trolls from the shitheads at KiwiFarms saying they faked their death, it's more than likely that they died because of the continued harassment.

The notion that I need to work the weekend finishing my coworkers' work if they call in sick 2 days in a row is an extremely fucked idea outside of software.

The agile notion of 'commitment' to churning out a specified amount of finished work exactly every 2 weeks is overtly hostile toward developers who want to make long-term decisions about the system.

I don't even know what he thinks that is going to accomplish or what 'consequences' he thinks are ever going to do anything. Dock our pay?

A fresh new avenue for Google to kill your SaaS startup: Google Safe Browsing,kz68tl,2021-01-17 21:14:41,,"On a similar note, I simply hate how Google flags sites and other products that depend on their services without much care.

I'm an app developer and I created a rather successful TV guide in my home country. Around 1 year after I published my app in the Play Store I got a message from Google saying that my app was suspended for promoting pirated content.

The thing is, my TV guide definitely has never promoted any pirated content. So I opened a dispute on Play Store console and asked them to explain what happened. Then a human being replied saying that after ""careful analysis"" they determined that my app was streaming illegal content from TV channels...

But my app never did that! If you search for ""TV guide"" in the Play Store you will find many apps that actually do this, but my app is not one of those, yet it was classified as an app that streams illegal content. What infuriated me the most is how they wrote that my app was deemed illegal after ""careful analysis"".

I sent a second appeal and asked them to point out exactly what part of my app was streaming illegal content, or any type of streaming at all. For my surprise, after this second appeal they restored my app in Play Store with neither a proper explanation nor an apology for their mistake.

I was mad but at least my problem was solved, right?

Actually no. Even though my app was restored in the Play Store, my Google Ads account got banned for the same stupid reason: I was supposedly displaying ads in an app that was promoting illegal content. So I could no longer monetize my app by displaying ads there. Actually I lost the ability to monetize ANY app and ANY website because they banned my entire Google Ads account.

I wrote a third appeal to Google, this time through the Google Ads site and I explained that whatever mistake was done by Google when they flagged my TV guide as illegal is now fixed because my TV guide was restored in the Play Store so I was expecting Google to also restore my Google Ads account.

But to my surprise Google replied saying that they wouldn't restore my Google Ads account because they have zero tolerance for illegal content... (insert confused Jackie Chan meme)

**TL;DR:** Google wrongly banned my app and my Google Ads account; after 2 appeals Google un-banned my app without any explanation or apology; but Google still kept the ban on my Google Ads due to a mistake that I never committed."

H.264 is magic.,6m9imx,2017-07-10 03:48:26,,"Decent explanation of the basic idea behind the basics, but some of it is outright wrong, and some of it could have been done better IMO. I'm gonna mention a few things here and provide some extra info about how much magic there is in H.264.

**Lossless vs. lossy?** Why not compare against uncompressed bitmaps while we're at it? Over 9000x savings! (Disclaimer: number made up)

Comparing a lossless encoding to a lossy makes for more impressive savings, but H.264 performs a lot better than the lossy JPEG, too, which in my opinion would have demonstrated its ""magicness"" even better.

**Frequency domain adventures** -- now with 87% less accuracy!

Let's gloss over how arbitrary and unhelpful I found the explanation of what the frequency domain is, and just mention it briefly.

While it's true that H.264 removes information in the frequency domain, it works quite differently from what's shown in the article. H.264 and virtually all other contemporary codecs use DCT (Discrete cosine transform or, in the case of H.264, a simplified variation) quantization on small blocks of the original image, as opposed to the Fourier transform (which uses sines in addition to cosines) performed on the whole image at once as shown in the example images. Why?

* When using cosines, less of them are needed in compression compared to sines. Don't ask me why, I'm not an expert. :)
* Unlike DCT, the discrete Fourier transform outputs complex numbers which encode the energy at each frequency, but also the *phase* (roughly speaking, how is the wave shifted? Do we need to move its peaks more to the left or more to the right?). Ignoring the phase info when transforming back into the original domain gives you a funky-looking image with lots of horizontal and vertical lines. The author apparently secretly fixed the phase data (and a bunch of other things) -- work that would be absolutely necessary to get the kinds of results he shows, but also completely irrelevant to H.264. With DCT you just throw away values (roughly speaking) and call it a day.
* Using small blocks confines the damage done by quantizing. Some detail is important, some detail is not. If you kill all the high frequency things, text and borders will be destroyed. When using blocks, you can adapt your quantization to the amount of detail you think is important in each block (this is why, in JPEG images, you often see subtle noise around letters on a solid background, but not in the rest of the background where there isn't anything else). At strong compression levels this will make things look ""blocky"" (different quantization in two neighbouring blocks will make for a harsh break between the two), but H.264 has fancy deblocking filters to make it less obvious.

**Use a theorem, *any* theorem!**

Speaking of frequency domain transforms, the author claims that the Shannon-Nyquist sampling theorem is about these transforms. That is completely false. The relationship is the other way around: the original proof of the Shannon-Nyquist theorem involved Fourier series, the work horse of the Fourier transform, but the theorem itself is really about sampling: digitizing analog data by measuring the values at a fixed interval (e.g. turning a continuous image into discrete pixels). Explanation of what that is all about here, in the context of audio: https://xiph.org/~xiphmont/demo/neil-young.html#toc_sfam

When it comes to frequency domain transforms, however, the relevant theorem is Fourier's theorem and it's about how well you can approximate an arbitrary function with a Fourier series and how many terms you need. In a discrete transform, the idea is that if you use enough Fourier terms so that you get exactly as many output values as there are input values, there is no information loss and the whole thing can be reversed. In math terms, the input function is locally approximated without error at all sampling points.

Another inaccuracy worth mentioning from that section: quantization isn't actually about removing values. It's about reducing the level of detail in a value. For instance, if I normally represent brightness as a value from 0-255, quantization might result in, say, eight different values, so I've quantized from eight bits of information to three bits. Removing a value completely is an extreme case of that, I guess: quantizing to zero bits... but it's kind of misleading to call that quantization.

*This is where the author stopped caring. No pictures from this point onward.*

**Chroma subsampling**

This is all reasonably accurate but omits an interesting piece of information: the trick of using less colour info than luminance info is almost as old as colour television itself. The choice of one luma and two chroma channels is for backward compatibility: luma basically contains black-and-white as before, and old devices that didn't support colour could simply throw away the chroma info. As it turns out, they actually *had* to transmit reduced chroma info because there wasn't enough bandwidth for all of it. Here's a nice picture to see how little the details in the chroma channel matters: up top the original image, followed by the luma channel and the Cb and Cr channels.

https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/29/Barn-yuv.png

Side note: the names Cb and Cr stem from ""blue difference"" and ""red difference"" since they were determined by subtracting the luma info from the red/blue info in the full signal.

**Motion compensation**, or: that's all there is to multiple frames

This is all essentially correct, but it might have been nice to mention that this is the most potentially expensive bit of the whole encoding process. How does motion estimation work? More or less by taking a block from frame A and shifting it by various amounts in various directions to compare the shifted block to whatever is in frame B. In other words, try many motions and see which fits best. If you factor in how many blocks and frames are being tested this way (in fact H.264 allows comparing to more frames than just the previous, up to *16*, so if you go all out the encode gets up to 15x slower), you can probably imagine that this is a great way to keep the CPU busy. Encoders usually use some fixed directions and limit how far a shift they try, and your speed settings determine how extensive those limitations are.

To make things even more complex, H.264 allows for doing shifts of less than a pixel. More searching means more fun!

**More magic!** More things the author didn't mention, probably because all of that math is full of ""mindfucks"" as far as he's concerned...

* Motion compensation: the encoder chooses macroblocks of different sizes depending on which size works best in a given frame/area.
* Motion compensation: a single macroblock can use multiple motion vectors.
* Motion compensation: prediction can be weighted which, for instance, allows encoding fade-outs into almost no data.
* Quantization: the encoder chooses between 4x4 and 8x8 blocks depending on how much detail needs to be preserved.
* Quantization: fancy extensions to allow more control over how the quantized values map back onto the original scale.

And finally, the kicker: psychovisual modelling, highly encoder-specific mojo that separates the wheat from the chaff in H.264 encoding. Many of the individual steps in encoding are optimization problems in which the ""best"" solution is chosen according to some kind of metric. Naive encoders tend to use a simple mathematical metric like ""if I subtract the encoded image from the original, how much difference is there"" and choose the result for which that difference is smallest. This tends to produce blurry images. Psychovisual models have an internal idea of which details are noticeable to humans and which aren't, and favours encoded images that *look* less different. For instance, to a ""smallest mathematical difference"" encoder, random uniform noise (e.g. a broken TV somewhere in the image) and a uniform colour area of mid grey have the same overall mathematical difference as random uniform noise and pseudorandom noise that is easier to compress than the original noise. A psychovisual encoder can decide to use the pseudorandom noise: it might need a few more bits but looks much closer to the original, and viewing the result you probably can't tell the difference."

Devs were given a DRM bypass CD that ignored the check for the wobble, but the CD that put the system in that mode *also* had the wobble so you can't really use that.

This guy dumped the CD drive ROM, and using that he was able to emulate the drive with his own custom board plugged into the video/CD slot which streams data to the console. The console boots into his board which has its own custom menu interface that just lists all files off the USB drive and allows you to select an ISO and boot into that.

He added some other cool features like writing/reading from the USB drive, so homebrew developers would be able to store savegame data or other data if they wanted.

Of course there's a bit more to it than that and I highly suggest watching when you can.

**edit**: it's also worth mentioning that as far as he's aware, he's the first one to dump the CD drive ROM. Emulator authors made a lot of assumptions about how the CD drive works and with his actual dump of the ROM he's been able to help them see exactly what the drive does."

Clarification: the ""30x speedup"" is for decoding of the fastest arithmetic coding (~50 MB/s) vs of ANS (~1500 MB/s) in benchmark [2] for similar compression ratio (better than Huffman, which standard implementation: zlibh from gzip has ~300MB/s).

A lot of this advice goes for other documentation too.

If someone asks you a question about your document, don't answer the question. Just fix the documentation, and answer ""check again and tell me if it's clear now.""  Eventually you stop getting questions.

As for ""prove a bug isn't there,"" this is where self-documenting code falls down. Code can't be self-documenting if the code isn't there. So the comment ""no need to check for buffer overflow here because ..."" is necessary.

This is what started it all, and it definitely got noticed. I am interested in the exchanges that led to this.

"""Programming Sucks"": A very entertaining rant on why programming is just as ""hard"" as lifting heavy things for a living.",3nv3rv,2015-10-08 01:23:50,,"Brilliant.

First programming job I had was doing a communications module for the first credit card gas pump system in our state (this was 1987) in, get this, Wang Basic.  It was a decent Basic, though, with labels for subroutines at least - and I wrote the program that would dial up the gas pumps and download the transaction information each night.

As I got into the refining and testing phase, the whole thing was quirky - I mean, some nights it would work perfectly, and other times the connection would drop and the next morning nada.   

After debugging and hacking for a week or so, it became clear that it wasn't my program, because it would fail one day and work the next with absolutely no changes to my code.  Yet, my @#!$@#$ boss kept accusing me.  I said no way, and we had to get the Wang people in, because the problem was with their modems, or somewhere else in their systems.  

Finally we got the local Wang office to send in their team to check it out - with everyone eyeballing me because my boss was convinced I was to blame, and this was costing a lot of money to call them in, making him look incompetent for hiring me.

I saw the head of local Wang division there, staring at a printout of my program, with this dumfounded look on his face.  I asked him if anything was wrong, and all he could say was, in this tone of disbelief:  ""I can actually read this."" I guess his guys were writing code from hell or something.

Code I wrote 20 years ago is center of a software patent lawsuit against Facebook,10jj8fo,2023-01-24 02:14:39,,"Back in 2002-2004 I worked for a small start up web development company (https://www2.7ware.com/) that is no longer in business. We had developed an in-house CMS portal that allowed customers to manage their own website content on our servers and have it appear on their webserver using an include file that was based around the ASP ServerXMLHttp component.  
  
Come to find out that my former boss had filed software patents on the code libraries I had written and was now using them to sue Facebook for damages. A few years ago Facebook had me summoned to give a deposition about the code and how it worked, though I couldn't quite recall all the details it after 20 something years. The lawyers for my former employer offered me legal assistance at no cost to me; I assume it was in their best interest to do so, and help coach me along the way. I ended up giving about 5 hours of testimony, most of which was ""I don't recall."" or ""I wouldn't say that.""   
  
Evidently Facebook lost some key summary judgement request allowing this lawsuit to continue on in favor of my former boss. Then to toss a wrinkle in to the whole thing, my former boss passed away a year ago, leaving the lawsuit to move forward under some sort of trust under his name.  
  
I don't try to pretend  to understand all the legal wording behind it all, but it seems that he court is siding with my former employer. To those of you who understand this stuff, what sort of ramifications if any, do you see these patents having on the software industry?"

C is 50 years old,u81ddn,2022-04-21 01:10:59,,"Up through the mid 1980s, many C compilers only recognized the first eight characters of symbol names. Variables, functions, whatever. Which could lead to strange behavior for people that liked to write long variable names.

In the late 1980s I had to port an embedded X86 development suite called Basic 16 from a pre System V Unix running on a Vax 11/750 to System V.2 running on that same Vax. Unfortunately for me, two realities collided. One, the compiler on System V.2 recognized symbol names of arbitrary length, and two, the people that had originally written and maintained Basic 16 commented the functions with extended names with their initials and dates appended.

so, for example, the original

int parse\_this\_whatever() ....

became

int parse\_this\_whatever\_dft\_102283\_tkt\_345()....

But then, all through the code, it was not called that way. And in some spots in the code, where functions were called was similarly modified.

They did the same for some static structure names as well.

Nightmare material.

Through a combination of sed and awk, I managed to programmatically edit the code to remove all the symbol name extensions, but that took a few tries to get it error free.

Even back then, a single target C compiler was a lot of lines of code, plus the linker, pre-processor, assembler, and the project included a debugger (B16STS) that could be linked to your embedded product and accessed over a serial line. A lot of code. A ton of headers.

And all of it was polluted as noted above. And it only built, for all those prior years, because the C compiler they were using only recognized the first eight characters.

When I had that nightmare effort complete, I documented it, and threw it back over the wall to the originating organization, out at Bell Labs Indian Hill.

It was subsequently ported the patched source to run under Solaris on a Sun 670 in the early 1990s. This second port was issue free, it just straight up compiled."

A 0Day vulnerability in MS Windows has gone public because Microsoft missed the canonical 120 days deadline,9is3l5,2018-09-25 21:26:21,,"Welp, Microsoft gets egg on their face for this one:

*  05/08/18 - ZDI reported the vulnerability to the vendor and the vendor acknowledged the report
* 05/14/18 - The vendor replied that they successfully reproduced the issue ZDI reported
* 09/09/18 - The vendor reported an issue with the fix and that the fix might not make the September release
* 09/10/18 - ZDI cautioned potential 0-day
* 09/11/18 - The vendor confirmed the fix did not make the build
* 09/12/18 - ZDI confirmed to the vendor the intention to 0-day on 09/20/18
* 09/20/18 - Coordinated public release of advisory

ZDI did everything possible to give Microsoft appropriate notice, **including giving several weeks of extra time for Microsoft to try to resolve issues with the fix so it could make it into their September release even after they had months to work on it, AND an extra week for emergency fixes even after it didn't go into the build**.  And still Microsoft managed to screw it up.

Software engineer keeps growing career despite facing impostor syndrome,tpz77u,2022-03-28 10:30:43,,"This is one of my favorite anecdotes on the topic of imposter syndrome, by the author Neil Gaiman:

Some years ago, I was lucky enough invited to a gathering of great and good people: artists and scientists, writers and discoverers of things.  And I felt that at any moment they would realise that I didn’t qualify to be there, among these people who had really done things.

On my second or third night there, I was standing at the back of the hall, while a musical entertainment happened, and I started talking to a very nice, polite, elderly gentleman about several things, including our shared first name*. And then he pointed to the hall of people, and said words to the effect of, “I just look at all these people, and I think, what the heck am I doing here? They’ve made amazing things. I just went where I was sent.”

And I said, “Yes. But you were the first man on the moon. I think that counts for something.”

And I felt a bit better. Because if Neil Armstrong felt like an imposter, maybe everyone did. Maybe there weren’t any grown-ups, only people who had worked hard and also got lucky and were slightly out of their depth, all of us doing the best job we could, which is all we can really hope for."

D has no vision. Go is out of its depth. Rust skipped leg day.,3sa6lf,2015-11-10 23:32:43,,"> GC is a great invention, but the decision to use it for D has instantly alienated a core market

Yes, I think that's exactly right, and I commend Andrei for being so straightforward about that.

I guess there is some argument about how to define a ""systems language"", but I don't think the label fits well on anything with GC.

Even if you had an extremely fast, state of the art collector (which I suppose is something that can be said about Go at this point), there are many cases in which the ever-present overhead will simply be unacceptable.

And yes, Rust has a disproportionate focus on one specific point (safety), but I think that's basically the problem with all the ""Big Agenda"" languages, [as Jonathan Blow called them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH9VCN6UkyQ#t=3m32s)."

Today's CPU vulnerability: what you need to know,7nyaei,2018-01-04 06:27:11,,"This exploit (meltdown) is surprisingly elegant.

Given a processor that caches each page as it is read or written:

1. Set up an array of 256 pages.
2. Read a byte of kernel memory.
3. (this happens before the fault can be thrown because of branch prediction & pipelining) Index into the array with that byte.
4. The CPU will throw a fault, but it will not evict the page from cache.
5. Measure how long it takes to read from each page in the array.

Addresses that are in the cache are way faster to fetch (see [the graph](https://i.imgur.com/eOA45Gs.png) from [the paper](https://meltdownattack.com/meltdown.pdf)), so you can figure out the contents of that kernel memory address!

There are too many different compilers that are subtly incompatible and you need too many additional CTAN packages to do even a simple document (I'm pretty sure the thousands of different `texlive-*` packages are responsible for about half the time it takes to do a dist-upgrade on my system). Most of the time all I need is simple PDF document, and Typst seems perfect for that.

Actually, I've been mentally sorting developers in a certain paradigm, for fun. Pick two:

* Energy 
* Ability 
* Ideas 

(""Energy"" might be better termed as ""perseverance"" or ""drive"" or something.) 

A rare person has good ideas, the energy and drive to start *and finish* them, and the ability to make it all work; we probably use things they've built all the time. 

But I've also seen that: the person with the talent *and* the stamina to code all day is working on some piece of another's unwieldy and ill-conceived buzzword-bank; the person with great ideas and boundless enthusiasm just doesn't know how to put them into practice, can't patiently hold focus on the jigsaw puzzle of abstractions in working memory; and those with both talent and creativity together get the spark then lose it, half-heartedly getting a few dozen lines in after work before quitting to watch Netflix in bed.

This is too simplistic in reality, of course. It depends on a lot of other factors, like time or mood, and there's no reason you can't find all three together (or none at all). Still, if probably just thanks to confirmation bias, I definitely feel like most people I know can be put down as having more of two and less of one."

The Missing Semester of Your CS Education (MIT course),eyagcd,2020-02-04 01:25:21,,"Over the years, we (/u/anishathalye, /u/josejg, and /u/jonhoo) have helped teach several classes at MIT, and over and over we have seen that many students have limited knowledge of the tools available to them. Computers were built to automate manual tasks, yet students often perform repetitive tasks by hand or fail to take full advantage of powerful tools such as version control and text editors. Common examples include holding the down arrow key for 30 seconds to scroll to the bottom of a large file in Vim, or using the nuclear approach to fix a Git repository (https://xkcd.com/1597/).

At least at MIT, these topics are not taught as part of the university curriculum: students are never shown how to use these tools, or at least not how to use them efficiently, and thus waste time and effort on tasks that should be simple. The standard CS curriculum is missing critical topics about the computing ecosystem that could make students’ lives significantly easier.

To help mitigate this, we ran a short lecture series during MIT’s Independent Activities Period (IAP) that covered all the topics we consider crucial to be an effective computer scientist and programmer. We’ve published lecture notes and videos in the hopes that people outside MIT find these resources useful.

To offer a bit of historical perspective on the class: we taught this class for the first time last year, when we called it “Hacker Tools” (there was some great discussion about last year’s class [on /r/programming](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/an3xki/mit_hacker_tools_a_lecture_series_on_programmer/) back then). We found the feedback from here and elsewhere incredibly helpful. Taking that into account, we changed the lecture topics a bit, spent more lecture time on some of the core topics, wrote better exercises, and recorded high-quality lecture videos using a fancy lecture capture system (and this hacky DSL for editing multi-track lecture videos, which we thought some of you would find amusing: https://github.com/missing-semester/videos).

We’d love to hear any insights or feedback you may have, so that we can run an even better class next year!

The .zip TLD sucks and it needs to be immediately revoked.,13fsvl5,2023-05-13 02:20:39,,"I feel like most people in the comments are not understanding the mechanism that makes this potentially problematic. I will admit that the author of the website, focusing primarily on his disdain for a particular corporation, doesn't help clarify the point.

A **significant** amount of software automatically converts parts of text that *appear* to be URLs (even without an explicit protocol) into clickable links. These include mail clients, messengers, internet forums, social media sites, CMS systems, text editors, etc.

Until now, such software would convert *hello.com* into a clickable link (since .com is a valid TLD) but would leave *hello.zip* as is (since .zip wasn't one). This won't change overnight, but gradually it will, as software libraries are updated with the current list of valid TLDs. This means that soon, whenever anyone mentions a zip file by name (in a message, email or a post), it will inadvertently become a link. To the reader, it will appear as if the author intentionally linked the file to assist the reader in finding it (e.g., ""Then you need to download [documents-backup.zip](https://documents-backup.zip) from our intranet portal""). So, they'll click on the link expecting to download the file.

As an attacker, all I have to do is register the *documents-backup.zip* domain and upload a malicious zip file to the root of the domain. It will starts downloading as soon as someone opens http://documents-backup.zip. The individual clicking on the link expects a zip file to download - and it will, but it will be a malicious file from a third-party, not from the author of the message or a post.

So as a result we get a **trusted** source inadvertently linking to a malicious file, which is very different from scenarios discussed in other comments.

**EDIT:** There were questions whether a zip file can be downloaded by simply accessing the root of a domain so I registered the domain and created a simple demo here: [documents-backup.zip](https://documents-backup.zip)"

Blockchain is not only crappy technology but a bad vision for the future,8fmg2y,2018-04-29 04:16:34,,"Every time I hear about the latest ""real-world problem"" that blockchain will solve, I think back to the difference between the Bruce Schneier who wrote Applied Cryptography (the bible for years on crypto) and the Bruce Schneier who wrote the Preface for Secrets and Lies - here's an excerpt:

> I have written this book partly to correct a mistake.

> Seven years ago I wrote another book: Applied Cryptography. In it I described a mathematical utopia: algorithms that would keep your deepest secrets safe for millennia, protocols that could perform the most fantastical electronic interactions-unregulated gambling, undetectable authentication, anonymous cash-safely and securely. In my vision cryptography was the great technological equalizer; anyone with a cheap (and getting cheaper every year) computer could have the same security as the largest government. In the second edition of the same book, written two years later, I went so far as to write: ""It is insufficient to protect ourselves with laws; we need to protect ourselves with mathematics.""

> It's just not true. Cryptography can't do any of that.

> It's not that cryptography has gotten weaker since 1994, or that the things I described in that book are no longer true; it's that cryptography doesn't exist in a vacuum.

> Cryptography is a branch of mathematics. And like all mathematics, it involves numbers, equations, and logic. Security, palpable security that you or I might find useful in our lives, involves people: things people know, relationships between people, people and how they relate to machines. Digital security involves computers: complex, unstable, buggy computers.

> Mathematics is perfect; reality is subjective. Mathematics is defined; computers are ornery. Mathematics is logical; people are erratic, capricious, and barely comprehensible.

> The error of Applied Cryptography is that I didn't talk at all about the context. I talked about cryptography as if it were The AnswerTM. I was pretty naïve.

> The result wasn't pretty. Readers believed that cryptography was a kind of magic security dust that they could sprinkle over their software and make it secure. That they could invoke magic spells like ""128-bit key"" and ""public-key infrastructure."" A colleague once told me that the world was full of bad security systems designed by people who read Applied Cryptography.

> ...

> A few years ago I heard a quotation, and I am going to modify it here: If you think technology can solve your security problems, then you don't understand the problems and you don't understand the technology.

Go read the whole [Preface](https://www.schneier.com/books/secrets_and_lies/pref.html), published online for free.  It was the most sobering read for a security geek who'd preached the greatness of crypto algorithms to ""make stuff secure"" for years (i.e. this dumbass)."

Thread by ex-Product Manager at Google on why Google Cloud Platform lost to AWS despite having better tech,kn4d94,2020-12-30 23:36:41,,"Back in 2008 I was asked to build a cloud platform for data processing. I won't go into details, but it imported data, processed and indexed it, and made the results accessible in a snazzy UI with some early machine learning to help things along. The goal was to be able to scale for 10's of thousands of users.

For a lot of reasons, I wanted that platform to be Google. Google was just getting into the cloud platform stuff, and I remember going to their offices and being prepared to be just blown away by their presentation.

God it was bad. The attitudes, the arrogance, and the sheer lack usability. Their documentation was so bad that their own engineers couldn't get demo API's to work. I walked into there ready to sign on the line that is dotted, and walked out of there thinking, ""shit, I guess it's amazon.""

Eight or nine months later our google sales rep called us and asked if we were ready to sign. He was really surprised when I told him that we were almost ready to ship with aws. He'd followed up exactly once after the demo, and hadn't really believed me when I said that we were going with aws."

    - Allow developers to integrate their apps and digital services directly with those belonging to a gatekeeper. This includes making messaging, voice-calling, and video-calling - services interoperable with third-party services upon request.
    - Give developers access to any hardware feature, such as ""near-field communication technology, secure elements and processors, authentication mechanisms, and the software used - to control those technologies.""
    - Ensure that all apps are uninstallable and give users the ability to unsubscribe from core platform services under similar conditions to subscription.
    - Give users the option to change the default voice assistant to a third-party option.

1. I loved what I did (started as a hobby, so work was fun).
2. I worked for a lot of start ups that had the pressure of ""get something profitable"". However it wasn't just downward pressure from owners, but also internal. I had equity, I identified my success with delivering and it fed my ego to an extent.

Over a decade and several burn outs later, I abhor overtime and love PTO.

Everytime I see someone working overtime, two thoughts go through my mind:

1. I really hope they don't get burned out.
2. Them working overtime to keep projects on schedule, prevents us from showing our need to have more resources allocated to our team. We sorely need more team members, but arguing for a budget increase for more resources when we're meeting goals is difficult.

TLDR:

Please don't work overtime unless you have (significant) equity. You hurt yourself, your team, and teach managers to expect it!"

He was working on programs built purely out of function composition, without using variable names to name intermediate results.

If anything, it is closer to the standard practice of concatenative and array languages, even if most of those also allow local names for readability when useful.

Just go check [John Backus' Turing Award Lecture](https://www.thocp.net/biographies/papers/backus_turingaward_lecture.pdf). The first code example he gives, on page 4, is:

IBM has open sourced it's own JDK as Eclipse OpenJ9!,70g4z7,2017-09-16 18:12:14,,"Man, the Internet circa 2017 is just awful.  Ten years ago, whenever a company open sourced something, it was greeted with celebration.  Just on principle, even if nobody planned to actually use it.

Today, whenever a company open sources something, so much of the feedback is negative.  ""*The thing sucks!*"" ""*The company is evil, doe!*""  ""*But it doesn't support X!*"" Etc.  Just on principle, people are psychologically trained to be negative and cynical about everything, because they see the more ""edgy"" comments getting upvoted to the top.

I'm kinda surprised that companies still bother.

Anyway, there are a lot basic questions in this thread, so let me try my hand at an alternative unofficial-FAQ, that assumes less prior knowledge than the one on the Eclipse site:

**IS THIS AN ALTERNATIVE JAVA COMPILER?**

No, this isn't the thing that compiles your Java source code into binary class files.  It's the thing that executes that binary code at runtime.  You might install this runtime on your server globally, or embed it with your application bundle (e.g. in a Docker container or something).

**WHY IS IBM OPEN SOURCING THIS, REALLY?**

Probably following Microsoft's lead.  Younger developers haven't thought about these old enterprise companies in awhile now.  And over time those younger developers become older decision makers, with budget.  So you can't sit back and let your mindshare erode forever.  

Between .NET Core and Visual Studio Code, Microsoft has more young developer eyeballs on them now than they did a few years ago.  Their hope is that over the long run, this will drive more business to Azure (or whatever).

Open sourcing a single JVM implementation (when there are already multiple other open source options) isn't as big a deal.  But it's something.  I'd guess that IBM just wants some younger folks talking about them again.  Maybe drive *some* business to BlueMix eventually?

**WHY WOULD I USE THIS?**

If you're just a hobbyist working on personal projects, or even an SMB (small to midsize business), then you probably wouldn't.  Maybe out of curiosity.  Or maybe if you're ideological, and think that Oracle's lawyers are more evil that IBM's lawyers or something.

However, a lot of big enterprises spent a LOT of effort on tweaking their Java applications for maximum runtime performance.  This means doing things like tweaking the low-level details of how the garbage collector works, or a ton of other config options.  Using profiling tools to test your application with various setups, and finding the best one possible.

At the next level, it might mean using a completely JVM implementation.  Of course there's OpenJDK, which is free but has the least amount of configuration extras.  There's the ""default"" Oracle binaries, which are sorta-free-as-in-beer, but have a lot of licensing traps (i.e. you have to pay to use the best profiling and optimization extras).  Then there are 3rd-parties, like Azul Systems, that sell forks of OpenJDK with their own secret sauce on top.

For large companies, or at least large-scale projects, this move represents a new 3rd-party option that you don't have to pay for.  Maybe it'll be good enough for some people's needs, that it eats into some business that would otherwise have gone to Oracle or Azul.

**IS THIS COMPATIBLE WITH REGULAR JAVA CODE?**

This seems to support the Java 9 standard library (the ""OpenJ9"" name suggests as much, but I'm kinda surprised that you have to go splunking through IBM's knowledgebase for real confirmation).

However, it won't have any of the `com.sun.*` packages, which only come with the Oracle binaries.  That used to be a bigger problem ten years ago or so.  Crypto libraries and other such things would depend on those classes, even though you're *supposed* to not use them.  Pretty much all major libraries have gotten the memo at this point, so it's not such a big problem.

Basically, if you app targets OpenJDK, then this should be able to run it just fine too.

**DOES IT SUPPORT SWING OR JAVAFX?**

This whole project looks to be a set of patches on top of OpenJDK, and OpenJDK includes Swing.  So that should be a ""yes"" for Swing.

JavaFX has a more complicated licensing history.  But at this point, it's as open source (i.e. OpenJFX) as anything else in OpenJDK... and there's no legal reason why OpenJDK forks wouldn't want to include it.  

But it's still usually kept separate for technical reasons (i.e. OpenJFX has a completely different build system from the rest of OpenJDK).  I know that Azul and Red Hat's OpenJDK forks don't include FX, and I doubt that IBM will include it either.  I would be pretty amazing if they did so, though.

EDIT:  Why thank you, golder-person!

With older UIs, I felt that the UI tried its best to be predictable, and the user just had to understand how it worked.

This means having an eye for detail, and being willing to push that bit harder to get the code ""right"", not just ""working"". Now (talented + passionate) usually => diligent, but the converse is not necessarily true, and a mediocre jobbing programmer who is nevertheless diligent can still be a good asset.

How to pick a starter project that'll make someone quit,wiih3x,2022-08-07 23:34:07,,"I'm pretty sure my current job regretted hiring me on the first day. I've been there for 4 years and I'm pretty sure they still regret it, so I'm not sure who the jokes on.

On the first day, I was thrown at a project that no one else had touched for 3 years. My ""mentor"" had no clue what I was working on, and he was overloaded being the tech lead of a ""very important"" project (on which he was the only developer). He never took less than a week to review my PRs, and usually took 2+ weeks. He wouldn't discuss any ideas for resolving that issue. 

I was up front with my manager about how I didn't like these circumstances. My biggest concern was that I was working alone on that project for my first 9 months (aside from no-comment 2-week-late PR approvals). I felt totally alienated from the whole engineering organization. He agreed that it was a problem and proceeded to do nothing. 

When that project ended, I was told to be the tech lead of my ""mentor""s project. At the same time, he was reassigned to another project. He left in his wake the tattered remains of the ""very important"" project that he had been working on. I was expected to pick that up and drag it across the finish line, but it was completely unworkable. When I brought this up with my ""mentor"", he agreed and shrugged. The project manager shrugged and said the schedule still had to be hit. My manager shrugged and told me to keep going. 

While I was busy propping up the dead body of this project, my manager had the gall to introduce me to a junior developer they hired. I had literally no warning, my manager just walked up to my desk one morning with this guy in tow and told me I had to onboard him. He was an awesome developer that at any other time would have been amazing to work with (I worked with him on other projects and he is amazing). The project we were working on was 90% Java/Hadoop mess and 10% AngularJS mess, so he just didn't have the skills to contribute much. I felt guilty because I didn't have the time to really help him and it was his first job.

Things haven't gotten much better, except that now I get away with working 2 hours a day since we're WFH. I'm still not sure who the jokes on."
Today is the 21th anniversary of the oldest temporary hack still in Linux kernel,66uqjv,2017-04-22 15:10:57,,"In the codebases that I’ve worked on, there’s generally a negative exponential distribution of FIXMEs/TODOs/etc. over time: most are addressed pretty quickly, but some stick around for years or even decades. It’s not pretty, but it does mean the code was “good enough” for all that time.

When debugging a customer issue, I really appreciate finding a detailed comment explaining potential deficiencies in the current code, because it gives me a useful starting point for implementing a fix. That information is harder to find when it’s buried in a bugtracker somewhere.

So even in personal projects, I write such comments in my code, and when returning to a project after a while, the first thing I do is tackle a few lightweight FIXME/TODO tasks. It really helps get me back into the mindset of the codebase, and makes things nicer for my future self, so it’s a practice I’d definitely recommend.

Most sites respond with:    

       X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff      

If the type is ""application/json"" you'll get the following error:    

    Refused to execute script from 'https://example.com/wat' because its MIME type ('application/json') is not executable, and strict MIME type checking is enabled.       

The needed MIME type is ""application/javascript."" So as long as you send nosniff and send back ""application/json"" instead of ""application/javascript"" for your JSON, then you're golden.    

Google likely keeps it due to backwards compatibility (e.g. IE 8). But due to XP's forced retirement, IE 8 seems to have fallen to under 1% of total web users so YMMV if you want to implement something which may be irrelevant within a year.

I had taken along a (quite early) copy of the GNU Emacs manual. The FSF was selling them, but I'd put this one together myself. Running TeX on the texinfo source, converting the output for the Imagen printer, and then taking it to Kinko's to be spiral bound, including my imitation of the yellow cover that the FSF version had.

I asked Minsky for his autograph. He looked at what I presented, understood what it was, an autographed inside the front cover, ""Marvin Minsky, friend of Stallman"".

In April of 2011 in an airport in Honolulu, I presented that same manual for an autograph to Richard Stallman. He looked my manual over for a long time. IIRC, it documents Emacs version 16 or 17. Then he signed it, below Minsky's autograph,

> At Netflix, our machine learning scientists deal with a wide variety of problems across a broad spectrum of areas: from tailoring TV and movie recommendations to your taste to optimizing encoding algorithms. A subset of our problems involve dealing with extremely sparse data; the total dimensionality of the problem at hand can easily reach tens of millions of features, even though every observation may only have a handful of non-zero entries. For these cases, we felt the need for a minimalist library that is specifically optimized for training shallow feedforward neural nets on sparse data in a single-machine, multi-core environment. We wanted something small and easy to hack, so we built Vectorflow, one of the many tools our machine learning scientists use."

Once you hear the solution, you remember it because it is elegant and succinct enough. People then forget it is hard their first time hearing it, and look down on those who they interview in the future.

If  you ever felt like you were coding on a deadline, spare a thought for the crew of [Apollo 14](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_14#Launch_and_flight_to_lunar_orbit):

>After separating from the Command Module in lunar orbit, the LM Antares also had two serious problems. First, the LM computer began getting an ABORT signal from a faulty switch. NASA believed that the computer might be getting erroneous readings like this if a tiny ball of solder had shaken loose and was floating between the switch and the contact, closing the circuit. **The immediate solution—tapping on the panel next to the switch—did work briefly, but the circuit soon closed again**. If the problem recurred after the descent engine fired, the computer would think the signal was real and would initiate an auto-abort, causing the ascent stage to separate from the descent stage and climb back into orbit. NASA and the software teams at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology scrambled to find a solution, and determined the fix would involve reprogramming the flight software to ignore the false signal. **The software modifications were transmitted to the crew via voice communication, and Mitchell manually entered the changes (amounting to over 80 keystrokes on the LM computer pad) just in time**.
